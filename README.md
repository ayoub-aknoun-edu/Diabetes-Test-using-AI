# Diabetes Ai Test

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether a person has diabetes or not using Machine Learning Algorithms. We will be using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database to train our models. The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Original dataset:  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes

## Overview
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
